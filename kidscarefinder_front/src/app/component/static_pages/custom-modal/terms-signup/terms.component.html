      <p class="termPara">If you choose, or are provided with, a user name, password or any other piece of information
        as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose
        it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to

      <p class="termPara">We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by
        you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion,

      <h4 class="termh4"><u>No Endorsement of Service Providers</u></h4>
      <p class="termPara">The Company does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any User Contributions or
        any other statement or service offered by a service provider listed on the Website and specifically disclaims
        any liability related any information contained herein. Should you use or rely on any information contained on
        the Website, the Company is not responsible or liable, indirectly or directly, for any damage or loss caused or
        alleged to be caused by or in connection with such use or reliance. Moreover, your interactions and/or
        engagement with any service provider found on the Website, and any agreements, representations, or warranties
        associated with such engagement, is between you and such service provider exclusively.</p>
      <p class="termPara">The Website and its service provider listings are for informational purposes only, with a goal
        of connecting users to professionals. Nothing on the Website is intended to be a substitute for professional

        provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Nothing on this Website is intended to
        substitute, nor supplement professional advice of any kind. </p>
      <p class="termPara">You should conduct independent due diligence on any service provider found on the Website
        before engaging in any way as the Company does not vet any service provider or verify any claims made on the
        Website. Moreover, while the Company runs a limited background check to receive a “background check cleared”
        badge on their profile, that background check is limited to confirmation that the licensing body for such
        provider has confirmed their license is in good standing as of the date indicated but does not represent (i) any
        endorsement of the service provider, (ii) endorsement of the quality of their services, or (iii) that the
        license is in good standing any time after the date indicated. </p>
      <p class="termPara">You agree that the Company is not responsible for the accessibility or unavailability of any
        service provider found on the Website or for your interactions and/or engagement with them in any capacity,
        waive the right to bring or assert any claim against the Company relating to any interactions and/or engagement
        with any service provider, and release the Company from any and all liability for or relating to any
        interactions and/or engagements with service providers. The Website is merely a database through which you can
        connect with certain service providers and the Company is not an agent of any service provider or user. </p>
      <p class="termPara">Without limiting the foregoing, your interactions and/or engagements with, and use or services
        of third parties or service providers found on or through the use of the Website are solely between you and such
        third party or service provider. You agree that the Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or
        indirectly, for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of
        the presence of such third parties or service providers on the Website.</p>

      <h4 class="termh4"><u>Arbitration</u></h4>
      <p class="termPara">To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past,
        present, or future, between you and the Company, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or
        arising out of this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and the Company may attempt to negotiate and settle such matter.
        The Company will provide notice to you at the physical address that you have provided to the Company. The
        Company’s address for such notices is: 6965 El Camino Real, Suite 105, #457, Carlsbad, CA 92009</p>
      <p class="termPara">If a Dispute is not resolved you agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes
        expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”). This Arbitration
        Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and evidences a transaction involving commerce.
        Unless otherwise agreed in writing, arbitration will be commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under
        the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where
        appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of
        which are available at the AAA website (<a href="#">www.adr.org)</a> Your arbitration fees and your share of
        arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
        Rules). Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that
        party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally,
        the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to
        resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this
        Arbitration Agreement other than that pertains to the class action waiver described below. </p>
      <p class="termPara">You and the Company agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration
        Agreement: (i) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our
        intellectual property rights; (ii) individual claims in small claims court; (iii) any claim that an applicable
        federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (iv) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
      <p class="termPara">WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION. To fullest extent
        permitted by applicable law, You and the Company agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual
        basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be
        brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (“Class Action Waiver”). Regardless of anything
        else in this Arbitration Agreement and/or the applicable AAA Rules or AAA Consumer Rules, the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be determined by a court and not
        an arbitrator.</p>
      <p class="termPara">A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate
        an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law
        prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied
        if the Dispute had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under
        applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual
        capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be
        forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the
        right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases
        and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration
        proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court
        of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.</p>
      <p class="termPara">If any portion of this Section entitled “Arbitration” is found illegal or unenforceable, that
        portion will be severed, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect.</p>
      <h4 class="termh4"><u>Limitation on Time to File Claims</u></h4>
      <p class="termPara">ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR
        THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF
        ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
      <h4 class="termh4"><u>Waiver and Severability</u></h4>

        deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and

        of such right or provision.</p>
      <p class="termPara">If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or
        limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force
        and effect.</p>
