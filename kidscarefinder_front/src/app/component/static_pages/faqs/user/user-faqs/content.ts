                <h3 class="faqh3">What does the 'verified license' badge mean? </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Kids Care Finder works with Sterling, a third party background check and license
                  verification provider. We send the required details over to their agency to run the background checks,
                  then deliver the results to our users from within our site.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">What does the 'cleared basic background check' badge mean?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Kids Care Finder gives non-licensed providers the option to clear a basic background
                  check when they sign up to be on the site. This runs their information through the enhanced nationwide
                  criminal database, the DOJ sex offender registry, the extended global sanctions records and traces
                  their social security number.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">If they clear these searches without any noteworthy offenses, then
                  they will
                  receive a 'cleared basic background check' badge next to their name.
                  Users will have an option to pay to request a copy of the background check or
                  run a more extensive one, should they be interested in doing so.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">What if I want to run a more extensive background check on a
                  non-licensed
                  provider? </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Users have the option to view a copy of a provider's basic background
                  check,
                  run a new version, or run a more enhanced background check as desired.
                  There are fees associated with running background checks on providers that
                  vary based on the option selected.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How does the waitlist functionality work?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">If a provider has their waitlist open, users can add themselves to the waitlist
                  through the provider’s profile. Once you’re added, Kids Care Finder will display which number you are
                  on the waitlist through the “My Providers” tab of the User Portal.
                </p>

                <p class="faqpara">Where can I view providers I have favorited or taken action with? Such as adding
                  myself to their waitlist, applied for, or requested enrollment for?</p>
                <p class="faqpara">The <i>“My Providers”</i> tab of your User Portal will display all providers you have
                  favorited, or taken action with, the status of your latest action, and allow you to take additional
                  action as desired.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How will I be notified once a provider I am on the waitlist for has a space
                  available?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You will be able to see what number you are on a provider's waitlist in your “My
                  Providers” tab of your User Portal.</p>

                <p class="faqpara">If you are first in line and a space becomes available, providers have the ability to
                  send you a message to determine if you are still interested, and invite you to apply, enroll, or
                  schedule a tour depending on where you are in the process.</p>



                <h3 class="faqh3"> How can I tell where I'm at on a provider's waitlist?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">If you are on a provider's waitlist, you will be able to see what number you are on
                  the waitlist under your “My Providers” tab of your User Portal.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How are search results sorted? </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Our unique algorithm for sorting search results helps increase your chances of
                  finding a provider. We combine provider availability, responsiveness, and how recently the provider
                  has been active on the site to display results in a way that rewards providers for responding timely
                  to user messages and requests. Providers who have our Search Result Optimization service will appear
                  at the top of the search results, followed by providers who score highly in the above mentioned
                  metrics.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How do I apply online and where does my application go?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">If a provider accepts online applications, there will be an option you can click that
                  says <i>“apply online.”</i> From there, you will either be directed to Kids Care Finder's application
                  template or to the provider's own external application link.</p>
                <p class="faqpara">If you apply via Kids Care Finder, the provider will be notified of your application
                  and able to view it in their Provider Portal. It will be up to them if they wish to invite you to
                  enroll, add you to their waitlist, or message you with any questions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How do I enroll online for a provider who offers online enrollment?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You will first need to <i>“request enrollment”</i> on the provider’s profile. If your
                  request is approved, you will receive a notification to enroll through your User Portal. On the <i>“My
                    providers”</i> tab, you will see the option to click <i> “enroll now,”</i> which will start the
                  online enrollment application.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">If you haven't already filled out your child’s information beforehand, you will be
                  asked to complete the “Enrollment details” section of your User Portal for the child/children you are
                  enrolling. It will ask you to fill out information on parents, medical, and authorized persons once,
                  then you can select each child you would like to apply those details for.
                  If all of your kids have the same contacts, then you can apply the same information for each of them,
                  and all you will need to complete per child is the health history.
                  From there, you will be taken to our electronic signature workflow, where we partner with DocuSign to
                  allow you to sign the necessary forms electronically. All forms will autofill with all of the
                  information you entered into the enrollment details section of your User Portal, saving you a ton of
                  time filling out the same information on each page.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">Once the DocuSign portion is complete, you will be given the option to upload
                  additional documents needed for enrollment, such as:
                </p>
                <div class="faqList">
                  <ul>
                    <li> The providers signed contract (they would provide you with a copy of this separately)</li>
                    <li> A completed physician's report (your pediatrician will need to complete this for you)</li>
                    <li>
                      A copy of your child's vaccination records (you can request this from your pediatrician).</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="faqpara">Then we will send all of this documentation to the provider in one, consolidated
                  enrollment package. Learn more by watching this Online enrollment tutorial video. Here's a sample
                  workflow for the online enrollment process:

                <h3 class="faqh3">What do the promoted/ premium results mean on the search results screen?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Some providers elect to turn on our Search Result Optimization service which places
                  them towards the top of the search results. They will appear bolded, highlighted, and with a premium
                  badge. This helps those providers stand out and fill openings more quickly.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">What if no providers meet the search criteria I entered?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You always have the ability to adjust your filters or search radius to increase the
                  amount of providers that appear on your search results screen.

                <h3 class="faqh3">What area(s) is Kids Care Finder available in?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We are currently available in San Diego county in Southern California.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">I need additional assistance that the video tutorials and FAQs did not answer. How do
                  I contact user support?</h3>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Why are there multiple background check options and what is the difference between
                  each of them?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Depending on what type of provider you are hiring and what you are hiring them for,
                  you may require a different level of information.
                  For example, if you are hiring a provider that is not expected to transport your children themselves
                  at any time, then you may not need a background check that contains the Motor Vehicle Report
                  information.
                  However, we strongly recommend running an enhanced background check on any provider you choose to hire
                  that is not licensed, especially if they will be caring for your children without you or another
                  trusted adult present.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> Is Kids Care Finder the one running background checks on non-licensed providers?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We partner with Sterling, a third party agency that conducts background checks. Kids
                  Care Finder has an automated connection set up with them to send all pertinent details from the
                  provider over to them. They send us back the background check, which we deliver to the user who
                  requested the information.
                  You can view the background check statuses and final report under the “My providers” tab in your User
                  Portal.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">What information do I need to provide to create a Kids Care Finder account?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">The basic information needed is first and last name, address, phone number, email,
                  and a password. With this information you can favorite providers as you are searching and create a
                  list of your top choices in providers without applying right away or losing your place in the search.
                  In order to message or take other action with providers, you will also need to add your
                  child’s/children’s basic details so providers know which age(s) you are inquiring for.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Why does the user portal ask for so much information?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We capture information about your children and the provider type(s) you are
                  interested in to be able to capture all of the necessary details from you to be able to make the
                  communication seamless and easier between users and providers. We also recommend that you upload a
                  family photo, and write a family description so that providers can see some basic information about
                  you to determine if you would be a compatible fit. The enrollment details section you can skip unless
                  you have been invited to enroll for a provider that requires the state enrollment forms. </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Do I have to create an account to search for Providers?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. You only need to create an account when you want to save a provider to your
                  favorites or use features like messaging, adding to a waitlist, applying, or enrolling for a provider.
                </p>


                <h3 class="faqh3">Do I have to fill out the enrollment details section if I'm not enrolling for a
                  provider online?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. The enrollment section can be skipped unless you are enrolling for a provider
                  that requires the state enrollment forms to be completed.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Is my information in the User Portal secure?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Yes. We use Google's technology and infrastructure to ensure Kids Care Finder has the
                  best security possible to protect your personal information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> Can the providers see all of the information I entered in the User Portal?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. Providers can only see the user's first name, last initial, photo, and family
                  description, as well as your child(ren)'s first name, last initial, and age.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">If you apply or enroll online for a specific provider, then the details from the
                  application or the completed enrollment forms will be shared with that provider.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">If the provider does not use our application or enrollment functions, then this would
                  be not applicable and the user would have to apply outside of Kids Care Finder however the provider

                <p class="faqpara">We will be adding more providers in the near future.</p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">How do I find a provider that fits my needs?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara"> Select a provider type from the home page and follow the prompts to apply your
                  search criteria. From the search results page, you can filter or sort your matched providers and click
                  on a provider to visit their Provider Page to learn more about them.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara"><i>Tip:</i> The less filters you select, the more options you will see on the search
                  results page. If you accidentally selected too many filters and no providers are shown, you can always
                  go back and remove some filters.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">Have all providers on Kids Care Finder cleared background checks?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Licensed childcare providers in California are required to clear background checks to
                  become licensed by the state. If they are licensed, it will be indicated on their profiles.
                  For non-licensed providers, Kids Care Finder offers an option to run a basic background check in order
                  to be cleared on our site. If they are cleared, a “basic background check cleared” badge will appear
                  next to their name on their profiles. However, this is an optional service and some providers may not
                  elect to do so.
                  Users ultimately must determine if a provider is suitable for hire and can elect to run a background
                  check on a non-licensed provider if they wish to do so.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">Has Kids Care Finder vetted the providers that are on the site?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. Kids Care Finder only displays available providers to users and helps filter
                  providers based on user search criteria. Kids Care Finder is in no way endorsing any of the providers
                  or stating that they are suitable for hire. Users are 100% responsible for doing their due diligence
                  to ensure a provider meets their standards and any requirements before hiring them.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> Can nannies or other families looking for a nanny share see my information and
                  contact me if they think we might be a good match?</h3>

                <p class="faqpara">In the “nanny preferences” section of your User Portal, you can elect to have your
                  profile visible to other users searching for a nanny share. That will enable them to message you if
                  they think you might be a good fit to share a nanny.
                  They will not be able to see any information other than your first name, last name initial, photo, and
                  family description, as well as your child(ren)’s first name, last initial and age.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> What happens if I run a background check on a provider and it turns out they have a
                  criminal record?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara"> Kids Care Finder will be notified of any providers who do not meet minimum screening
                  requirements of a background check. We will work with our background check partner to have the
                  Provider removed from the site.
                  The minimum requirements to pass are that they have committed no major or violent crimes, do not have
                  drug or alcohol related crimes, and do not appear on the DOJ sex offender registry.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">If a non-licensed provider does not have a 'basic background check cleared' badge,
                  does that mean that they had a background check run but did not pass?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara"> It's possible they did not meet our criteria to receive a cleared background check
                  badge, but did not have any severe issues on their background check and are still able to be listed on
                  the site. Some examples of this would be misdemeanors or traffic violations.

                  It's also possible that they did not elect to have their background check run upon signing up. If a
                  provider has a background check run, you will be able to request a copy or run your own background
                  check on them.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">Do the non-licensed providers have to run a background check to appear on Kids Care
                  Finder?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara"> No, it is not required. It is an optional service we offer that a provider can elect
                  to do. You are able to filter non-licensed providers to see only those who have cleared a basic
                  background check.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">Why is Kids Care Finder better than other sites for finding childcare providers?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Here are a few key differentiators that make Kids Care Finder the best site to find a
                  childcare provider:
                </p>
                <div class="faqList">
                  <ul>
                    <li>No subscription fee for users to have an account and find providers
                    </li>
                    <li>An extensive range of different provider types
                    </li>
                    <li>Features on the site include messaging, opting in/out of waitlists, online applications, and
                      automated enrollment
                    </li>
                    <li>Information from each provider is clearly display to save significant time when trying to
                      determine if a provider meets your needs
                    </li>
                    <li>The way we sort providers in the search results maximizes your chance of finding a provider.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> How do I report a provider who has done something wrong?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">If it is an issue relating to the responsiveness, service received, or experience
                  with a provider, you can post a review on their provider page.
                  If it is a serious issue that requires escalation, you can e-mail us at <a
                    href="usersupport@kidscarefinder.com">usersupport@kidscarefinder.com</a> with a detailed description
                  of the issue(s) and any other helpful information. We will conduct an investigation and respond with
                  any action taken. </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> Should I run a background check on a provider even if they have a badge stating that
                  they have cleared a basic background check?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We strongly recommend running an enhanced background check on providers who are not
                  licensed at the time you decide to hire them. Even if they cleared a basic background check or another
                  user ran a check previously, anything that occurred since the last background check would not show up
                  on the results. If the provider is expected to drive your children, we also urge you to run a check
                  that contains Motor Vehicle Report information.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> How does the nanny share functionality work?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">If you are interested in hiring a nanny and would like to share the nanny with
                  another family in your area, this is a great feature that other nanny websites do not offer. You can
                  find other families in your area searching for a nanny share and once you find a good match, you can
                  hire a nanny together that meets all of your needs.
                  If you already have a wonderful nanny and are just looking for a family to share with, you can
                  indicate that in the nanny share workflow you will answer.
                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">How are providers selected to be on the site?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We invite all available providers to sign up to be on Kids Care Finder. We do require
                  certain provider types to be licensed, and we will display which licensed providers have had their
                  licenses verified by Kids Care Finder.</p>
