                <h3 class="faqh3">How do I appear as a ‘promoted' provider in user searches?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">When you are selecting your account type, select our Premium account with Search
                  Result Optimization. This will make you appear towards the top of the search results, highlighted,
                  bolded, and with a premium badge next to your provider name.

                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3">Do I have to enable all of the functionality Kids Care Finder offers?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. You have the option to pick and choose which pieces of functionality you have
                  turned on and you can make changes at any time.
                  For example, if your waitlist is getting long and you would like to close it, you can turn it off in
                  your Provider Portal. This will not make any changes to the users you already have on your waitlist
                  and you can move, remove, or message users from your waitlist tab of your Provider Portal.

                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How do I review user applications submitted via Kids Care Finder?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Click the ‘Applications’ tab in your Provider Portal. From there, you can view all of
                  your new applications in the top section or any previously viewed applications in the bottom section.
                  You can view applications or take action for the user who applied from the application screen.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> If my waitlist is getting too full and I want to turn it off, can I do so without
                  losing the users that are currently on it?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Yes, closing your waitlist will not lose any users or details that have already been
                  added. You can do this by toggling to the left hand navigation bar of your Provider Portal to close
                  your waitlist.

                </p>


                <h3 class="faqh3"> How do I manage my waitlist?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">From your Provider Portal, click on the 'Waitlist' tab. From there you can search,
                  move, remove, or take action with a specific user. You can also view our <a

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How does online enrollment work?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Users will first need to 'request enrollment' and you will have the option to approve
                  the request before the user is able to enroll electronically.
                  Once you have approved them, the user will see a link to 'enroll now' on the 'My Providers' tab in
                  their User Portal. That link will start the online enrollment application.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">After they complete all the details of the application, they will be taken to our
                  electronic signature workflow through DocuSign to allow users to sign all necessary forms
                  electronically. Once the DocuSign portion is complete, users will be given the option to upload
                  additional documents needed for enrollment, such as:
                </p>

                <div class="faqList">
                  <ul>
                    <li> Your signed provider contract (you would provide them with a copy of this separately)</li>
                    <li> A completed physician's report
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How are search results sorted? </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We have a unique algorithm for sorting search results that helps increase your
                  chances of becoming a family’s new provider. We combine provider availability, responsiveness, and a
                  provider’s level of activity on the site to display results in a way that rewards providers for
                  responding timely to user messages and requests.
                </p>
                <p class="faqpara">Providers who have our Search Result Optimization service will appear at the top of
                  the search results followed by providers who score highly in the above mentioned metrics.
                </p>


                <h3 class="faqh3"> What if more than one provider matches the search criteria and has the Search Result
                  Optimization turned on? Which provider will appear on top and how will the promoted providers be
                  sorted?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We have a unique algorithm that will alternate which of the promoted providers
                  appears at the very top of the promoted providers section. It will rotate the promoted providers each
                  time there is a matching user search so that all promoted providers are equally listed at the top of
                  the search results page.

                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> How will I know how many users have visited my provider page or how many search
                  results I appeared in?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You will be able to see user activity in your Provider Portal at any time. We will
                  also send your administrators a monthly summary email that contains several key data points related to
                  your user activity.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How will users know when two or more providers are affiliated with each other?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">From your customized provider page, there will be a section that lists out your other
                  affiliated providers. Users can click on those provider pages from your provider page and vice versa.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> If I am a non-licensed provider, do I have to clear a background check to be on Kids
                  Care Finder?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You do not have to clear a background check to be on the website. However, we
                  strongly encourage you to do so, as families will be able to filter providers based on those who have
                  a 'Basic background check cleared' badge. If you do not opt into clearing your background check and a
                  user applies that filter, you will not appear in the search results. </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> What if a user wants to run a more extensive background report?

                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Users will be given multiple background check options that they can elect to run if
                  they are interested in hiring a non-licensed provider. They will be able to choose the level of
                  information they wish to see and the charge(s) associated with the option they select would be paid
                  for by the user.
                  You will need to approve the background check request they submit before it is run.

                  and complete our unique questionnaire. Once you have completed the questionnaire, your customized
                  provider page will be live. You can manage your information and settings from your Provider Portal.

                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">What information do I need to become a Provider on Kids Care Finder?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Depending on your provider type, you will complete a unique questionnaire that asks
                  many key details families need to know up front to determine if a provider is a potential fit for
                  their child(ren).
                  Questions range from basic information and license information (if applicable), to schedule and
                  availability, meals and snacks, nap time, tuition, and more.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How long does it take to sign up to become a provider on Kids Care Finder?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Depending on your provider type, we estimate it takes between 10-20 minutes to
                  complete the questionnaire and account setup process.

                </p>


                <h3 class="faqh3">Why does the provider questionnaire ask for so much information?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">One of the differentiating factors of Kids Care Finder is that we display a great
                  deal of information up front for users, making it much easier to narrow down providers that are a
                  potential fit for their child(ren)'s unique needs.
                  Without this information, users will typically spend hours calling and emailing providers to ask the
                  same basic questions and providers are taken away from the children they care for to respond to all of
                  these inquiries.

                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Why is it asking me to run my own background check in the questionnaire?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">It is optional but it will help improve your chances of being hired by prospective
                  families.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> I am an administrator for a provider but I also would like to search for providers
                  for my children. Can I use the same account?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">No. There are different functionalities between the Provider and User Portals so you
                  will need to create a separate account for your user needs.

                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> How often should I update my availability?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">We recommend updating your availability monthly or as changes occur. We will send out
                  a monthly email to you recapping all of your user activity with Kids Care Finder and that email will
                  have a reminder embedded to update your availability at that time.

                </p>
                <h3 class="faqh3"> Should I keep my account active even if I do not have availability?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Yes. We recommend keeping your account active so users can add themselves to your
                  waitlist or apply online for future enrollment. You also can manage or maintain your provider details
                  at any time in your Provider Portal.

                <h3 class="faqh3">What if I want to change my account type after signing up?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">You can change your account type or update any of your provider details at any time
                  via your Provider Portal.</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">How do I update information after completing the questionnaire?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Through your Provider Portal, you can click on the tab that says 'Update provider
                  details’ and you will be able to update any of the information you entered during the initial signup
                  questionnaire.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> What if I have an affiliated provider but I haven't completed the questionnaire and
                  created an account for that business yet? Can I add it later as an affiliated provider?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Yes. You can add affiliated providers at a later time through your Provider Portal
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">Will users have access to my background check report?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Users can request a copy of a background report that has already been run on you if
                  they choose to do so. You will need to approve the request before they are able to receive a copy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="faqh3">What if I have my own online application template I want users to apply with?</h3>
                <p class="faqpara">When you complete the provider questionnaire, you will be able to either use the Kids
                  Care Finder online application template or insert a link to your own.

                  online applications, online enrollment, and more, you would need to select one of our premium account
                  options.
                  Our premium accounts start at just $10/ month for single providers and $25/ month for large centers/
                  facilities. We do not take any additional fees or commissions outside of the monthly subscription fee.

                  to appear at the top of the search results screen bolded, highlighted, and with a premium badge, there
                  is a higher monthly subscription fee than our standard Premium account. It is not an additional fee,
                  but rather, a higher monthly subscription fee.
                  The only other fee providers could potentially pay is for unlicensed providers. We offer the option to
                  pay to run your own background check and receive a 'Basic background check cleared' badge. This helps
                  providers stand out among others and make families feel more comfortable in reaching out to you. This

                      currently offer 13, plus the nanny share feature. We also expect to launch several more in the
                      first half of 2023</p>

                    <li>Provider information is readily accessible on the website, both on provider profiles and the
                      search results screen
                    </li>
                    <p class="faqpara">This saves users a significant amount of time spent calling and emailing
                      providers to ask the same basic questions over and over. This also saves providers a lot of time
                      responding to all of these inquiries.</p>

                    <li>Services included in the provider account dramatically help to reduce the provider's
                      administrative load
                    </li>
                    <p class="faqpara">This includes our waitlist management tool, an online application template, and
                      an online enrollment process (if applicable).</p>

                <h3 class="faqh3"> I offer childcare services but I do not see my provider type listed as an available
                  option. Will you add additional provider types?
                </h3>
                <p class="faqpara">Yes. We have several additional provider types coming soon such as drivers,
                  photographers, birthday parties/entertainment, nanny agencies, surrogacy and fertility, pediatricians
                  and dentists, sleep coaches, night nurses, and more!
